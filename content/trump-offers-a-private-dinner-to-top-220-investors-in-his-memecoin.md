Petition for a private dinner to the president

The Turkish government said on Wednesday that it would be a meeting of the top top 20 investors in the country's biggest bank and investment firm, the World Bank, to discuss how to use the money to help the country recover from the financial crisis.

"We will discuss the possible use of the funds to help the country recover from the crisis, but we will also discuss how to use them to help the country strengthen its economy," the prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said in a speech at the World Bank.

The Turkish government also said that it would meet with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to discuss how to use the money to rebuild its economy.

The meeting is due to be held after the president's trip to China on August 5.

The World Bank and the EU are the two main donors to Turkey. The World Bank contributed $1.3bn to the Turkish economy in 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

This is up from $3bn in 2013 and $7bn in 2008.

The World Bank has a long-standing reputation for helping the world's poorest people. But the funds it has received have been used for projects that have been successful in alleviating poverty in more than a dozen countries, including the United States, which is one of the world's poorest nations.

This is the second time the World Bank has worked with the European Union – the first was in 2006.

The World Bank has been able to help the world's poorest people by supporting the creation of a host of projects, including a project to develop food security for the developing world, and a project to help make sustainable agriculture more sustainable.

The World Bank has also been able to help the World Bank's international partners by helping to develop infrastructure in countries on the ground in Syria and Central Africa to help secure the supply of food and water for people living in poverty, say the World Bank's chief financial officer, James Cook.
